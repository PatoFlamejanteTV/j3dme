## Building

For detailed instructions on how to set up your environment and build the project, please refer to the platform-specific guides:

- [Building on Windows](docs/BUILDING_WINDOWS.md)
- [Building on Linux](docs/BUILDING_LINUX.md)
- [Building on Termux](docs/BUILDING_TERMUX.md)

## Running

After building, you can run the application using a J2ME emulator. The `dist` directory will contain the necessary `J2MECube.jar` and `J2MECube.jad` files. Refer to the platform-specific building guides for emulator recommendations.
